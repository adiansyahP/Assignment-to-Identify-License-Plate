Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) would be employed to simulate the airflow and optimize booster design for thrust and stability. Material selection (lightweight yet durable fabrics, high-temperature resistant metals for boosters, etc.) is crucial.\n\n2. **Booster Production:**  This would likely involve metal 3D printing or CNC machining for intricate parts, followed by assembly and rigorous testing in controlled environments.  Nozzles and valves would require precise manufacturing tolerances.  The steam generation system (likely miniaturized boiler and heat exchanger) would need to be compact, efficient, and safe.\n\n3. **Battery Production:**  High-density, fast-charging battery cells would be required.  This could involve partnerships with existing battery manufacturers or specialized cell fabrication. Battery management systems (BMS) are critical for safe operation and optimal power delivery.\n\n4. **Electronics and Controls:**  Circuit boards would be designed and manufactured to control the boosters, monitor battery levels, and manage the user interface (potentially a small display or voice activation). Firmware would be developed and tested to ensure reliable and safe operation.\n\n5. **Backpack Assembly:**  The backpack itself would be fabricated using techniques similar to high-performance backpacks.  Reinforced stitching, durable fabrics, and padded straps would be essential for comfort and safety.  Integrating the boosters, battery, and control system into the backpack structure would require precision assembly and quality control.\n\n6. **Testing and Certification:**  Extensive testing would be necessary to ensure safety and performance. This would include flight tests with dummies, environmental testing (temperature extremes, humidity, etc.), and durability testing.  Meeting relevant safety and regulatory standards (e.g., FAA regulations) would be crucial for commercial viability.\n\n7. **Mass Production:**  If successful in testing, the manufacturing process would be scaled up.  This could involve setting up automated production lines for certain components (like the backpack body), while other parts (like the boosters) might require more specialized assembly.\n\n8. **Quality Control:**  Stringent quality control throughout the manufacturing process is paramount.  Regular inspections, performance tests, and rigorous safety checks are crucial to ensure a reliable and safe product.\n"

        "Gemini models are trained to return bounding box coordinates as relative widths or heights in the range of [0, 1]. These values are then scaled by 1000 and converted to integers. Effectively, the coordinates represent the bounding box on a 1000x1000 pixel version of the image. Therefore, you'll need to convert these coordinates back to the dimensions of your original image to accurately map the bounding boxes."

One of the most iconic and studied storms on Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, which is an anticyclone that has been raging for more than a century. Since there's no land mass on Jupiter, the storm hasn't been slowed down. However, data from NASA suggests that the spot is getting smaller and has been since 1995, but it's also growing taller.Â NASA scientists are using data collected from the Voyager, Hubble, and Juno missions to further investigate the Great Red Spot, hoping to unlock more of the planet's mysteries.\n\n**Quiz Questions**\n\n1.

The Great Red Spot is not easily visible.\n[00:00:47 to 00:01:00] Jupiter rotates against the black background. An inset image of the Great Red Spot appears showing its shape in 1995, 2009, and 2015, with a dotted line tracing its edge. The spot has become smaller over time.\n[00:01:00 to 00:01:05] The video zooms in to the Great Red Spot.\n[00:01:05 to 00:01:13] A figure skater is spinning on an ice rink.\n[00:01:13 to 00:01:17] The video zooms in on the Great Red Spot from a low angle.\n[00:01:17 to 00:01:25] A black-and-white still image and then a clip of a potter shaping clay on a potter's wheel are shown, side-by-side. There is also a graph showing the growth of the Great Red Spot in recent years.\n[00:01:25 to 00:01:30] Jupiter against a black background. The inset image reappears, showing its shrinking over time.\n[00:01:30 to 00:01:36] The Great Red Spot is now the size of Earth. The Milky Way moves past. \n[00:01:36 to 00:01:46] Two spacecraft and Jupiter are seen in space.\n[00:01:46 to 00:01:54] Jupiter against the Milky Way background. The Great Red Spot is seen again, with the video zooming in closer and closer.\n[00:01:54 to 00:01:57] The video stays in place over the Great Red Spot as the clouds move.\n[00:01:58] The video returns to black.\n[00:01:59 to 00:02:06] A NASA Goddard Space Flight Center logo appears on the screen as the Earth is visible in the background."
